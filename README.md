## Brief introduction
Portfolio website, designed and inspired after i have seen my colleagues portfolios, as a challenge to myself i started developing this application in January 1st, 2022 and finisehd it by January 6th, 2022. Before developing this project i created an initial design to help me visualize the final outcome, and i am glad about that because now i am satisfied with the final outcome, also it increased my experience a bit, so its a win-win situation. Hope you enjoy your tour!
