This project purpose is to showcase my works in an elegant way, as well as my education certificates, my CV to be downloaded, and the ability to contact me directly using a simple form.

Portfolio website, designed and inspired after i have seen my colleagues portfolios, as a challenge to myself i started developing this application in January 1st, 2022 and finisehd it by January 6th, 2022. Before developing this project i created an initial design to help me visualize the final outcome, and i am glad about that because now i am satisfied with the final outcome, also it increased my experience a bit, so its a win-win situation.
